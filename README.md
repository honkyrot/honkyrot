Some small SE Asian boy who likes to code.  
I do like gaming; from competitive to anime.
yeah, I'm addicted to gacha games


I do want to do more hobbies like music, but that can wait.
I know so far Lua and Python, but I do wish to learn more languages later on.
Languages such as C# and JavaScrip have been touched on and could expand on.

So, a little about me. The country I'm from is Myanmar or Burma. But left for the United States early on in my life. Currently in Indiana and I like it here. Still in high school doing my final year. Hoping for an intership or something?
