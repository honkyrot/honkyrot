## honkyrot
Some small SEA guy who likes to code.  
I do like gaming; from competitive to anime.
yeah, I'm addicted to gacha games

## about me
I know Lua, Python, JavaScript, and some C# so far. But I do wish to learn more languages later on.
I also wish to develop some apps for Android.
Seems easier to learn new syntax the more experience you have.
I am still a student who's learning new things every day.


## stuff I do
I do projects in Python, JavaScript, Lua, and C#, and maybe a little in Roblox Studio if I feel like it.
Essentially: applications, web-based programs, and games.

I am also learning Unity too on top of that so that's cool.
